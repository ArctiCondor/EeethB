### About me

Hello, and welcome to *yet another rstats blog*! My name is Ethan Brockmann.

I am an actuarial analyst and R developer at BlueCross BlueShield of Mississippi, where I build and manage pricing and underwriting models, as well as a variety of regular and ad hoc data reporting. I also build or rebuild everything that I can in reproducible and clearly documented ways using R and RStudio. I'm the author and maintainer of the company's first internal R package, used for safely interacting with the company's database. Any day I use R is better than it was before!

One of my passions is the R community, and I try to give back where I can. My first R package, [`edgedata`](https://github.com/EeethB/edgedata), can be installed from CRAN. I have a few other packages in the early planning stages, but the one I'm most excited about (as of this writing - November 1, 2020) is a Shiny application that would connect R users struggling to find community in their local areas. I also just enjoy interacting with the R community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EeethB) and the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/u/EeethB).

### A bit more about me

I attained a BS in mathematics from Mississippi State University with a minor in computer science in 2017. I enjoyed tutoring, working for MSU Outdoor Adventures, and the Starkville Russian Club during my time in Starkville. 

When I'm not working or learning more about R, you can find me spending time with family or climbing on my home bouldering wall. I also enjoy reading psychology books, such as *The Body Keeps the Score*.
