<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hello, and welcome to <em>yet another rstats blog</em>! My name is Ethan Brockmann.</p>
<p>I am an actuarial analyst and R developer at BlueCross BlueShield of Mississippi, where I build and manage pricing and underwriting models, as well as a variety of regular and ad hoc data reporting. I also build or rebuild everything that I can in reproducible and clearly documented ways using R and RStudio. I’m the author and maintainer of the company’s first internal R package, used for safely interacting with the company’s database. Any day I use R is better than it was before!</p>
<p>One of my passions is the R community, and I try to give back where I can. My first R package, <a href="https://github.com/EeethB/edgedata"><code>edgedata</code></a>, can be installed from CRAN. I have a few other packages in the early planning stages, but the one I’m most excited about (as of this writing - November 1, 2020) is a Shiny application that would connect R users struggling to find community in their local areas. I also just enjoy interacting with the R community on <a href="https://twitter.com/EeethB">Twitter</a> and the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/u/EeethB">RStudio Community</a>.</p>

<h3>A bit more about me</h3>
<p>I attained a BS in mathematics from Mississippi State University with a minor in computer science in 2017. I enjoyed tutoring, working for MSU Outdoor Adventures, and the Starkville Russian Club during my time in Starkville.</p>
<p>When I’m not working or learning more about R, you can find me spending time with family or climbing on my home bouldering wall. I also enjoy reading psychology books, such as <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em>.</p>
