# About Me

I am an actuarial analyst at BlueCross BlueShield of Mississippi, where I build and manage pricing and forecasting models using SAS and Excel, as well as a variety of regular and ad hoc data reporting. I'm interested in any jobs that use more R and ~~less~~ no SAS or Excel. I love R and the R community, and I recently contributed to the R community with my first public package: [`edgedata`](https://github.com/ArctiCondor/edgedata), now on CRAN. I have built other internal R packages for BCBSMS. I attained a BS of mathematics from Mississippi State University with a minor in computer science in 2017. When I'm not working or learning more about R, you can find me spending time with family and climbing on my home bouldering wall.
