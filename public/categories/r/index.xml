      <description>The R community is so welcoming!
This is a sentiment I encounter almost every day in talks, on Twitter, and on personal blogs. And it’s a sentiment I agree with and feel. But I think in some ways it’s incomplete. Because at times the R community is not so welcoming. I also see people ranting, mostly on Twitter, about the horrible design or structural decisions people have made in their projects.</description>

      <title>Parsing XML with {tidyr}</title>

      <description>When I first discovered xml2, I was thrilled. A product from RStudio that works with XML! So great! I had some large XML documents I had to parse at work, and my best solution (before we got RStudio) was to drag them one at a time into Microsoft Excel and let its parser convert each into one big, ugly table. Then I was left to either create some elaborate formulas to extract the relevant info, or pass the table on to SAS and try to wrangle it there.</description>
