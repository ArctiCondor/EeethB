      <description>About Me I am an actuarial analyst at BlueCross BlueShield of Mississippi, where I build and manage pricing and forecasting models using SAS and Excel, as well as a variety of regular and ad hoc data reporting. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in any jobs that use more R and less no SAS or Excel. I love R and the R community, and I recently contributed to the R community with my first public package: edgedata, now on CRAN.</description>

      <title>Parsing XML with ~~`xml2`~~ `tidyr`</title>

      <description>When I first discovered xml2, I was thrilled. A product from RStudio that works with XML! So great! I had some large XML documents I had to parse at work, and my best solution (before we got RStudio) was to drag them one at a time into Microsoft Excel and let its parser convert each into one big, ugly table. Then I was left to either create some elaborate formulas to extract the relevant info, or pass the table on to SAS and try to wrangle it there.</description>
