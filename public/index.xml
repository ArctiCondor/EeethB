      <description>When I first discovered xml2, I was thrilled. A product from RStudio that works with XML! So great! I had some large XML documents I had to parse at work, and my best solution (before we got RStudio) was to drag them one at a time into Microsoft Excel and let its parser convert each into one big, ugly table. Then I was left to either create some elaborate formulas to extract the relevant info, or pass the table on to SAS and try to wrangle it there.</description>
