## Resume

Resume on Ethan Brockmann's personal website. This site was built with [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses the [Hugo devresume](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-devresume-theme/) theme.

This is a long-term branch that will be used to host my resume. It's done as a branch instead of a separate repository because it's so closely related, and Netlify can do automatic branch subdomains, which is convenient.
