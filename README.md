## [yet another rstats blog](https://ethanbrockmann.com)

Ethan Brockmann's personal website. This site was built with [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses the [Hugo Persian](https://themes.gohugo.io/persian-hugo/) theme.

## Under development

A portion of this site under early development is an apps page. I'm really interested in the concepts behind Docker, so I've been learning how to host a Shiny server on an old laptop using Docker. You can check in on how it's going at http://apps.ethanbrockmann.com.

You can view my full resume/CV at https://ethanbrockmann.com/resume.pdf. It is built with a slightly edited version of Mitchell O'Hara-Wild's fantastic [`vitae`](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package for building resumes/CVs and cover letters with R Markdown. The edits I made allow for a couple additional social icons: [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/u/EeethB) and [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/ethan-brockmann).

Eventually I'd like to port my resume over to the [devresume](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-devresume-theme/) Hugo theme and host it on Netlify as well. Progress on that is on the `main` branch of this repository.
